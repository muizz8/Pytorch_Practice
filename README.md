# PyTorch Practice

Welcome to my PyTorch_Practice repository! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where I explore and experiment with various concepts and techniques in PyTorch.

## Contents

- **Introduction to PyTorch**: Basics of PyTorch, including tensors, operations, and basic functionalities.
- **Neural Networks**: Implementation and training of neural networks using PyTorch.
- **Dataset and DataLoader**: How to handle datasets and use DataLoader for efficient data processing.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Steps for training neural networks and evaluating their performance.
- **Advanced Topics**: Other advanced topics and techniques in PyTorch (e.g., transfer learning, custom models).

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
pip install jupyter
```

## Usage

To start the Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the directory containing the notebook and run:

```bash
jupyter notebook pytorch_practice.ipynb
```
